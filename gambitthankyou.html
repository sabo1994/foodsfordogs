<h1>THANK YOU!</h1>

<p class="text"><img class="happygambit" src="images/happygambit.jpg">Thank you for your support! I am very excited to try some tasty beef jersky! Three sticks a day should do the trick! Wish I could pop through the screen and give you a kiss! But unfortunately that won't be possible. Instead, if you donate food to at least <b>FOUR</b> of my friends below, I can give you a new T-shirt! Thanks again!<img class="resize" src="images/saddog6.jpg"><img class="resize" src="images/saddog1.jpg"><img class="resize" src="images/saddog4.jpg"><img class="resize" src="images/saddog5.jpg"></p>
